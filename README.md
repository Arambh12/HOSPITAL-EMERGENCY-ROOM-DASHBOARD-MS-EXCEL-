### 1. Project Title / Headline

### Hospital Emergency Room Insights Dashboard using MS Excel
A dynamic, interactive visualization designed to monitor emergency room (ER) performance metrics, patient demographics, referrals, and overall service efficiency.

### 2. Short Description / Purpose

The Hospital Emergency Room Dashboard provides hospital administrators and healthcare teams with a clear and real-time overview of ER operations. It tracks patient flow, waiting times, satisfaction scores, admission rates, and departmental referrals. The tool is designed to optimize resource allocation, reduce delays, and enhance patient care.

### 3. Tech Stack

The dashboard was built using the following tools and technologies:

• 📊 MS Excel – Main data visualization platform used for report creation.

• 📂 Power Query – For data cleaning, transformation, and reshaping prior to visualization.

• 🧠 DAX (Data Analysis Expressions) – Used to create custom measures and dynamic KPIs.

• 📝 Data Modeling – Built relationships across tables (patients, admissions, referrals) for seamless analysis.

• 📁 File Format – .xlsx for dashboard creation and .png for dashboard previews.

### 4. Data Source

Source: Simulated hospital ER patient data for January 2023.

The dataset covers:

Patient demographics (age, gender).

Admission status and satisfaction scores.

Average wait time and patient delay metrics.

Departmental referrals (e.g., orthopedics, neurology, cardiology).

KPIs related to monthly ER operations.

### 5. Features / Highlights
### 🔹 Business Problem

Hospitals often struggle to monitor emergency room operations efficiently, leading to long waiting times, poor satisfaction, and resource misallocation. There is a need for an interactive reporting tool that captures real-time patient flow, bottlenecks, and performance metrics.

### 🔹 Goal of the Dashboard

To deliver an interactive visual tool that:

Tracks ER efficiency through key KPIs.

Identifies patient demographics and admission patterns.

Highlights referral distribution across departments.

Helps administrators make data-driven staffing and operational decisions.

#### 🔹 Walkthrough of Key Visuals

### Top KPIs (Top Row)

Total No. of Patients: 154

Average Wait Time: 35.27 minutes

Satisfaction Score: 4.80/5

Patient Attendance Status (Pie Chart)

On-time: 94 patients

Delay: 60 patients

### Gender Analysis (Donut Chart)

Female: 51%

Male: 49%

Admission Status (Table)

Admitted: 82 patients (53%)

Not Admitted: 72 patients (47%)

#### Age-wise Distribution (Bar Chart)
Shows how patient visits are distributed across age groups (e.g., highest in 20–29 age group).

Departmental Referrals (Horizontal Bar Chart)

Most referrals: General Practice (31)

Others include Orthopedics, Cardiology, Physiotherapy, Neurology, etc.

93 patients did not require referral.

### 🔹 Business Impact & Insights

Operational Efficiency: Monitoring delays vs. on-time attendance helps reduce bottlenecks.

Patient Care: Identifies departments with high referrals, guiding better resource allocation.

Demographic Analysis: Age and gender breakdown supports targeted staffing (e.g., younger patients form the bulk of visits).

Satisfaction & Wait Time: Links performance with patient experience, driving quality improvement initiatives.
